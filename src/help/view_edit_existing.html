        <h2>View/Edit Existing Images</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="ft">
        <p>This screen gathers information about which images you would like
          to view or make changes to. These images must have been previously
          added via the <em>Process New Images</em> screen or they must have
          been published to the Bioimages website already.</p>
        <a id="uniqID">
          <h3>1. Select whose images to load</h3>
        </a>
        <p>This is the unique ID of the agent whose images you wish to load. Usually
          this will be the unique ID of the person entering information into this
          software. This setting is also used as the default agent in when creating
          a new determination later in the software. You may have already have been
          given a unique ID. The  most common forms are either your last name plus
          first and possibly second initial (e.g. John Doe -&gt; doej). If you do
          not already have a unique ID, click the <em>Create New ID</em> button and
          fill out the required information.</p>
          <h3>2. Select location of image files</h3>
        </a>
        <p>Click this button and locate the folder containing the images you wish
          to load. The default setting is to only load images that have been
          added or modified locally. In other words, images that have metadata
          that differs from what is on the Bioimages website; changes you have been
          working on. If you want to load all of your images for viewing, even ones
          that have already been published to Bioimages, check the box 'Load all
          records for selected agent, including for images previously submitted'.</p>
          <h3>3. Continue</h3>
        </a>
        <p>For most users that is all that needs to be done. By clicking <em>Continue</em>
          the selected images and metadata will show up on the data entry screen.</p>
          <h3>Advanced Options</h3>
        </a>
        <p>There are a few more advanced options. One advanced option is to load
          everyone's images by checking the box. There is a placeholder thumbnail
          for any images that you do not have locally so that you may still look at
          their metadata.</p>
        <p>The <em>Selected folder is root of namespace folders</em> checkbox is useful
          if you are loading images from multiple namespaces. Check this box then in step
          2. <em>Select image folder</em> select the parent directory that contains the
          namespace folders that you are loading images from. This option goes well with
          the 'Load everyone's iamges' checkbox assuming you have images from other
          photographers on your computer.</p>
        <p>Lastly there is an option to clear the thumbnail cache. The cache is used to
          store thumbnail versions of the images you load. It serves two purposes: to
          speed up loading the Data Entry screen (the screen after you click Continue
          from this screen) and to continue showing thumbnails of images you have viewed
          before even if you no longer have those images on your computer any longer.
          There are two reasons you may want to clear the cache. If you have edited the
          appearance of an image (e.g. cropping it) after you have loaded it with this
          software, the thumbnail will still show the old version of the image. Clearing
          the thumbnail cache will fix this. Another reason, although unlikely for most
          users, is that if you load tens of thousands of images with this software then
          the thumbnail cache will grow to several hundred megabytes in size. If you rarely
          view that many files (e.g. maybe it was a one-time thing that you loaded so many)
          you may clear the cache to free up disk space.</p>
