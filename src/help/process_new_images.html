        <p>This screen begins collecting information about the images that you
          would like to be added to the Bioimages website.</p>
        <a id="uniqID">
          <h3>Who are you? Selecting the default agent</h3>
        </a>
        <p>This sets the default agent in dropdown boxes, such as the namespace
          and photographer boxes on this screen or the default agent when
          creating a new determination later in the software. Usually this will
          be the unique ID of the person entering information into this
          software. You may have already been given a unique ID. The most
          common form is your last name plus your first and possibly second
          initial (e.g. John Doe -&gt; doej). If you do not already have
          a unique ID, click the <em>Create New ID</em> button and fill out the
          required information.</p>
        <a id="bulkrename">
          <h3>If necessary, bulk rename your image files now</h3>
        </a>
        <p>It is important for your files to have unique filenames. All images
          by a given photographer, both previously submitted and new submissions,
          will reside in a single folder on the Bioimages server. It is therefore
          important that you not reuse filenames that you have used in the past.
          It can be helpful to have a systematic method of naming your image files,
          e.g. rgd00001, rgd00002, rgd00003. If in the past you uploaded 100 files,
          from rgd00001 through rgd00100, it is important that the next time you add
          images you begin at rgd00101 or some other filename that you have not used
          already. It should be noted that spaces in image filenames are not allowed.</p>
        <p>There are several powerful file renaming utilities for download from the
          internet that allow you to easily rename many files at once using your own
          particular naming scheme. Bulk Rename Utility (http://bulkrenameutility.co.uk)
          is an excellent such program for Windows systems.</p>
        <p>If you are going to change image filenames, do so before step 3.</p>
        <a id="selectfiles">
          <h3>Select files to add to Bioimages</h3>
        </a>
        <p>Under most circumstances the image namespace will be the same as
          the photographer. In the special cases of assembling a specific tree
          tour or having multiple contributors in a class or bioblitz the namespace
          may be set to something reflecting these special cases. In the case of the
          class the instructor's namespace may be used or a namespace specific
          to the class.
        <p>Next is the photographer box. If the photographer of these images
          was not you, select that photographer's unique ID. Then click <em>Select
          image files</em> to select the images taken by that photographer. If
          you are importing images from multiple photographers, repeat these
          steps of selecting the photographer's unique ID and then selecting
          the images taken by them. If the photographer has not yet been given
          an agent ID, click the New Agent button above to make them one.</p>
        <h3>Back to start screen (changes will be lost)</h3>
        <p>If you decide you do not wish to add new images at this time but
          wish to use some other function of the Bioimages Collection Manager, click
          this button to go back to the start screen. Any files you have
          selected were not added to the database and will be unselected next time
          you enter this screen, but you can just select them again and continue.
          If you created a new agent that will be saved.</p>
        <h3>Selected images - Clear all</h3>
        <p>This box displays all of the images you have selected to add to
          Bioimages. If you decide you do not want these files to be added,
          click <em>Clear all</em> and go back to step 3 to add the images that
          you want.</p>
        <a id="done">
          <h3>Done</h3>
        </a>
        <p>Clicking <em>Done</em> will switch to the image metadata entry screen.
          Before clicking <em>Done</em>, at a minimum you must have set the
          default agent ID (step 1) and selected some image files (step 3).</p>
        <p>When <em>Done</em> is clicked, it begins creating thumbnails and
          extracting EXIF data from the selected images. This may take a
          little time depending on how many images you are adding. You may
          begin working as soon as any thumbnails show up; you do not need to
          wait for all of them to load. In the future when you load these
          images via View/Edit Existing Records from the start screen they will
          load much faster.</p>
