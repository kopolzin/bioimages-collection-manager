        <p>This screen provides advanced features that primarily only the website
        administrator for Bioimages will have use for.</p>
        <h3>Resize images</h3>
        <p>A function is provided to resize the full-size images down to the
          various resolutions used on the Bioimages website. When resized to
          thumbnails (tn) the larger image dimension is scaled down to 100 pixels,
          low quality (lq) images are scaled down to 480 pixels, and good quality
          (gq) images down to 1024 pixels.</p>
          <p>The namespace is the name of the folder that the images will reside in on the
          Bioimages server. Typically it is the agent ID of the photographer or their
          organization's ID. When images are resized they will be saved to the following
          folders: &lt;base_output_directory&gt;/tn/&lt;namespace&gt;/,
          &lt;base_output_directory&gt;/lq/&lt;namespace&gt;/, and
          &lt;base_output_directory&gt;/gq/&lt;namespace&gt;/.</p>
        <h3>Generate Bioimages website</h3>
        <p>Generation of the website from the metadata records is now
          handled by XQuery scripts available at <a href="https://github.com/baskaufs/Bioimages">
          https://github.com/baskaufs/Bioimages</a>.</p>
