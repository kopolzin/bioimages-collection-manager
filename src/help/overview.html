        <h3>Overview</h3>
        Bioimages Collection Manager was created to ease the process of adding images of
        living organisms and metadata about them to the
        <a href="http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu">Bioimages website</a>.<br><br>
        Cross-platform and open-source, the software was designed with minimal dependencies
        making it very simple to install as well as to extend and build it yourself if you wish.<br><br>
        No internet connection is required which makes it useful at remote sites, but web services
        such as reverse geocoding and updating the database to the latest published version of
        the Bioimages metadata are built into the software if you wish to use them.<br><br>
        Metadata collected follow biodiversity informatics best practices using terms from the
        Biodiversity Information Standards (<a href="http://www.tdwg.org/">TDWG</a>),
        the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative
        (<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">DMCI</a>), and the Darwin-SW
        Ontology (<a href="https://github.com/darwin-sw/dsw">DSW</a>). Due to following these
        standards, the data users input into this software and submit are of great use to
        biodiversity researchers and the public. In addition to the Bioimages website data
        submitted are also sent to biodiversity aggregators such as the Global Biodiversity
        Information Facility (<a href="http://www.gbif.org/">GBIF</a>) and the Encyclopedia
        of Life (<a href="http://eol.org/">EOL</a>).<br><br>
        If you would like to contribute images to the project, please contact Steve Baskauf
        at steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu.
