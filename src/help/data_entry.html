        <h2>Data Entry</h2>
        <h3>Screen layout</h3>
        <p>This screen is where all of the image information is entered. The
          upper-right box contains thumbnails of all images you selected on the
          <em>Process New Images</em> or <em>Edit Existing</em> screen.
          The upper-left box contains a large view of the thumbnail you have
          selected. All other boxes are fields to enter information about the
          selected images, the organisms those images represent, and the
          determinations of those organisms.</p>
        <p>The lower-left and lower-right sections (below the large view and
          below the thumbnail view, respectively) contain input fields for data
          corresponding to images. This means that every JPEG image, which is
          represented by a thumbnail, has its own distinct copy of these fields.</p>
        <p>The center column contains input fields for organisms and determinations
          which are labeled as such. An organism is a particular specimen, say the
          cherry tree in my front yard. If I take fifteen pictures of that tree
          they are all representing a single organism. Once I group those thumbnails
          and assign a unique ID to the organism I only have to enter the organism's
          metadata once, not fifteen times (once per picture).</p>
        <p>Determinations are similar in that they refer to identifications of
          a specific organism and do not need to be entered for every image.</p>
        <h3>General data entry procedure</h3>
        <p>The general procedure is to select one or more image thumbnail and
          enter information about the selected image(s). To speed up data entry,
          selecting multiple thumbnails is advisable. The logical unit is an
          organism--multiple images taken of a single organism will contain
          nearly all of the same data so it speeds things up to select all of
          them and only enter the data once. As a way to assist with this when
          a thumbnail is selected all other thumbnails from the same organism are
          given an orange border to help identify them. Following is an example
          procedure to input data about images.</p>
        <h3>Example procedure:</h3>
        <p>1. In the upper-right corner of the screen select all thumbnails taken
          of an individual organism.</p>
        <p>2. Click the <em>Group selected thumbnails as an individual organism</em>
          button to give this organism a unique ID. This lets others easily know
          that all of these images were taken of the same organism. When you make
          changes to the input fields, the changes are automatically saved. This
          means that the <em>Organism ID</em> field is now automatically saved for
          the images you have selected after you clicked the <em>Group</em> button.</p>
        <p>3. Fill out the data fields that are exactly the same for all of the
          selected images. Many times cameras do not correctly save the time zone
          in the Exif data so that is a good one to highlight all images and set
          at once. The timezone must be in the format of 'Â±hh:mm' with either the
          minus sign or the plus sign.</p>
        <p>Once you have finished entering the image metadata that are the same for
          the selected images you may want to enter organism metadata. If you are
          just changing a single organism's data there is no need to have all of its
          images selected; a single one will do. Just remember to select all of the
          images for an organism before pushing the <em>Group</em> button. As with
          image metadata, when you fill out the organism metadata any changes you
          make to the input fields are automatically saved for all selected
          thumbnails. There is no extra step required to save. If you accidentally
          close the program or turn off your computer, all of the data you have
          entered will load correctly when you re-run the software.</p>
        <p>4. For the fields that differ, e.g. <em>Specimen Part</em>, select
          each thumbnail separately and enter its information.</p>
        <p>The one exception for different field values is when reverse
          geocoding. You may have many different thumbnails selected, which may
          be disparately located geographically, but pressing the <em>Reverse
          Geocode</em> button will correctly save the location data to each image
          individually. In other words, it would be easiest to select all
          thumbnails (select one thumbnail then e.g. press ctrl-a on Windows
          computers or command-a on Macs) then click <em>Reverse Geocode</em>.
          For every image that had latitude and longitude stored in its Exif or
          that you filled out manually, the county, state, country, continent
          and potentially locality fields will automatically be filled out. The
          first time a specific latitude and longitude are reverse geocoded the
          results are stored locally in a cache. Future requests for those
          exact same coordinates will use the values in the cache. If for some
          reason you are not satisfied with the cached results you may check
          the 'Bypass cache' checkbox to query an external web service for
          new values.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="bd"></div>
      <div id="ft"><p>5. Once all fields have been filled out for the first
        organism, return to step 1 and select the thumbnails for another
        organism.</p>
      <h3>Continuing later</h3>
      <p>If you weren't finished with your changes you can quit at any time and
        start where you left off by going through the <em>Edit Existing</em>
        option at the start screen.</p>
      <h3>Exporting metadata to CSVs</h3>
      <p>If you would like to share your metadata with others, when data for all
        images have been entered return to the Start Screen by clicking
        <em>File-&gt;Return to Start Screen</em> then click the <em>Manage
        CSVs</em> option. On the new screen that appears is an option to
        <em>Export CSVs</em>.</p>
      <p>This will save all of the image, organism and determation data that you
        have been working on as well as any new agents, taxa names, or sensu records
        that you have created to pipe (|) delimited CSV files that can then be
        sent along with the image files to be uploaded to Bioimages. In the
        future this will be handled automatically by uploading to the Bioimages
        server with no need to export CSV files.</p>
      <h3>Selecting multiple images</h3>
      <p>When several thumbnails are selected and a field contains multiple
        different values for those images, <em>&lt;multiple&gt;</em> is shown
        in that field's entry box. Mousing over the box will display a list of
        the various values for this field that the selected images have. If you
        wish to change all of the different values to a single one, simply fill
        out the field with the new value. For example, multiple images are
        selected and for the field <em>Locality</em> some images have the value
        "Near X", some have "Near Y", and some are left blank. If you decide all
        of those selected images were in fact "Near X", simply delete the
        <em>&lt;multiple&gt;</em> that is displayed and type in "Near X". This will
        replace the value for all selected images.</p>
      <h3>Adding new agents or sensu</h3>
      <p>If you wish to add new agents or sensu records there are options to do so
        in the menu bar under the <em>Add</em> menu.</p>
      <h3>Table view</h3>
      <p>There are powerful table views available from the menu bar under the
        <em>View</em> menu. Selecting <em>Locally modified records</em> will only
        load records that have been edited locally on your computer, so any images
        you have been working on. The option <em>Entire database</em> will load
        all Bioimages metadata as well as any records you have been working on.</p>
      <p>Using the Locally modified records view can be a very easy way to review
        the records you have been modifying. It is possible to correct mistakes or
        enter data from this view. When you are satisfied with your changes, click
        <em>Save changes</em>. This saves any changes you have made to every table,
        not just the one you are currently viewing. Clicking Save changes does not
        close the table view; if you are finished you must click the close button.</p>
      <p>You will likely have the Data Entry screen open at the same time as the
        Table View. This can be very useful to use the Table View as reference while
        entering metadata into the Data Entry screen. If you have made changes in
        the Data Entry screen and would like the Table View to be refreshed to
        display those new values, click <em>Revert unsaved changes and refresh
        database</em>. You will lose any changes you made to the Table View and
        any changes you made on the Data Entry screen will now be reflected in the
        Table View.</p>
      <p>If you have mistakenly added records that you wish to delete, select the
        offending row or rows and click <em>Delete selected rows</em>. Records
        that have previously been published to Bioimages can't be deleted; instead
        their data are automatically reset to the published values.</p>
      <h3>Sorting and filtering</h3>
      <p>Sorting and filtering are powerful features to help you quickly process
        images. Sorting reorders the thumbnails; there are options to order by
        an image's name, its unique identifier, the date and time it was taken,
        and to order by organism ID. Sorting causes all thumbnails to become
        visible, undoing any filters you had set, so sort first then filter.</p>
      <p>There are two types of filters: basic preset filters and advanced filters.
        Explore the basic preset filter options--many of them make it much easier
        to find out what images you have yet to enter information for, such as
        GPS coordinates or identifying the taxa.</p>
      <p>Advanced filters are essentially SQL queries that let you create very
        precise, custom filters for deciding which thumbnails to show. The query
        already contains "SELECT x FROM images WHERE ", so your contribution just
        has to be in the form of "dcterms_modified &gr; '2015-09'" or multiple
        statements grouped together like "x = y AND a &lt; b".</p>
