        <p>This screen provides advanced features. Resetting the database may be useful
        for users but the other features on this screen are primarily for the website
        administrator of Bioimages.</p>
        <h3>Reset database</h3>
        <p>If you wish to undo all changes you've made and reset the database to factory
        defaults, you're in the right place. This method of resetting the database is
        an easier alternative to uninstalling and reinstalling the software.</p>
        <p>To procede, tick the checkbox then click the Reset button.</p>
        <h3>Resize images</h3>
        <p>A function is provided to resize the full-size images down to the
          various resolutions used on the Bioimages website. When resized to
          thumbnails (tn) the larger image dimension is scaled down to 100 pixels,
          low quality (lq) images are scaled down to 480 pixels, and good quality
          (gq) images down to 1024 pixels.</p>
          <p>The namespace is the name of the folder that the images will reside in on the
          Bioimages server. Typically it is the agent ID of the photographer or their
          organization's ID. When images are resized they will be saved to the following
          folders: &lt;base_output_directory&gt;/tn/&lt;namespace&gt;/,
          &lt;base_output_directory&gt;/lq/&lt;namespace&gt;/, and
          &lt;base_output_directory&gt;/gq/&lt;namespace&gt;/.</p>
        <h3>Extract and convert taxonomic names from ITIS</h3>
        <p>This software uses taxonomic data from ITIS. The data are bundled with the
          software so there is no need for the user to install anything. This function
          is for the software developer to easily update to the latest ITIS dataset,
          which is released monthly.</p>
          <p>The process is simple. First, download the most recent dataset and extract
          it. The direct download link is <a href="https://www.itis.gov/downloads/itisSqlite.zip">
          https://www.itis.gov/downloads/itisSqlite.zip</a>. Then click the
          "Select ITIS database and convert" button and select the extracted ITIS.sqlite file.
          The software will then load the database and convert it to use our schemas. This
          may take a few minutes due to its large size. Afterward, the ITIS.sqlite database
          will contain a table 'taxa' which can be used by this software as a source of
          taxonomic names, or it may first be filtered down with SQL commands to the desired hierarchies.</p>
