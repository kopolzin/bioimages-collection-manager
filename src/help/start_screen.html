        <h2>Start Screen</h2>
      </div>

        <p>Several actions may be taken from the start screen. The most common
          option is to process new images.</p>
        <h3><strong>Process New Images</strong></h3>
        <p>Clicking this button begins the process of importing image files for
          use on the Bioimages website. The image files should already be in a
          folder on your computer and renamed to the filenames you would like to
          submit them as.</p>
        <h3><strong>View/Edit Existing Records</strong></h3>
        <p><strong></strong>Clicking this button brings you to a screen where
          you can select image records to edit that were previously added through
          the Process New Images step. Under the Advanced Options on this
          screen you may even select to view metadata for images from all
          contributors that have been published to Bioimages to date.</p>
        <h3>Help</h3>
        <p>Clicking this button displays these help files.</p>
        <h3>Bioimages Logo</h3>
        <p>When a new version of the Bioimages metadata has been published, you
          will be alerted that there is an update by a message over the top of
          this logo. Clicking the message will cause the software to update the
          metadata, merging the latest published records with your local records.
          If there are any conflicts, such as records you have been working on
          differ from the recently published data, you will be prompted on how
          to merge the conflicts.</p>
        <h3>Manage CSVs</h3>
        <p>This screen contains options to manage character-separated files. The
          software uses a database internally but it can be convenient for users
          to store backups of their data in CSV files. On this screen the user
          can export metadata changes they have made on their computer to CSV files.
          They can also export the entire Bioimages database to CSV files if they
          wish. There is also an option to import CSV files, either of the same
          format as that of the exported CSVs or in a two-column format, e.g. if
          an external GPS unit was used it is possible to import a file that
          contains a list of image names and a list of coordinates. Lastly, there
          is an option to merge multiple CSV files together.</p>
        <h3>Generate Bioimages Website</h3>
        <p>This is an advanced feature that primarily only the website administrator
          for Bioimages will have to use. It currently provides a function to resize
          the full-size images down to the various resolutions that the Bioimages
          website uses. Aggregation of all image data checking for errors and
          creating the HTML files for the Bioimages website is now handled by XQuery
          scripts.</p>
