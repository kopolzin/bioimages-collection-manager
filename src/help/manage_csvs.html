        <p>This screen contains options to manage character-separated files. The
        software uses a database internally but it can be convenient for users
        to store backups of their data in CSV files.</p>
        <a id="export">
          <h3>Export database to CSV files</h3>
        </a>
        <p>If you wish to make a backup copy of your metadata or if you want
          to submit your data to be published on the Bioimages website, you
          can click the Export button. There is a checkbox and the default
          state of being checked will result in only changes that you have made
          locally on your computer will be exported. This is a safe choice and
          and work you have done will be in the resulting CSV files. You can
          also uncheck the box and the entire Bioimages database will be
          exported to CSV files. Most users will not have use for this. Columns
          in the exported files will be character-delimited by the pipe (|)
          character.</p>
          <h3>Merge CSV files</h3>
        <p>If you have exported your work several times and possibly on
          several different computers you may wish to combine those CSV files
          to reduce clutter. This option performs that function.</p>
        <p>First select a group of CSV files that you would like to merge other
          files into. Then select a second group of CSV files whose content
          you would like to merge into the first files. This second group can
          have multiple versions of the same sort of file, for example multiple
          images.csv files. The names of the files do not actually matter since
          the first line of each CSV is read the column headers and determine
          what type of CSV it is. So it is perfectly fine in the second group
          to select both images-from-work-computer.csv and images-from-laptop.csv
          and the software will figure out how to merge them all properly.</p>
          <h3>Import CSV files into the database</h3>
        <p>There are two categories of CSV files that you can import into the
          database. The first category consists of CSV files that correspond
          directly to tables in the database. These include agents.csv,
          determinations.csv, images.csv, names.csv, organisms.csv and sensu.csv.
          Rows in these CSV files directly correspond to records in the database
          and contain exactly the same fields.</p>
        <p>The second category consists of CSV files that contain two columns:
          one column contains an identifier and the other contains a value for
          some field. Importing this type of CSV is an easy way to load in
          large amounts of data that you gathered together elsewhere. For example,
          you may have a CSV file containing GPS coordinates in one column and
          the corresponding image filename in the other column. Importing this
          way will be much faster than copying and pasting by hand for every
          set of coordinates. However, it should be noted that for this second
          category of CSV files you can only import records whose filename
          or identifier already exists in the databaes. So if you try to import
          coordinates for filename abaca853.jpg but no such image exists
          within the database, those coordinates will not be imported. This
          contrasts wih the first category which will import records even if
          they do not exist yet.</p>
        <p>There are several options for importing two-column CSVs. If you
          are importing data using an image's filename then you should be aware
          that if that filename is not unique within the database then data
          will not be imported for it. Another thing to watch out for is that
          if your CSV file does not have a header row then uncheck 'CSV contains
          header row' or else you will lose that first row of data. The column
          separator field defaults to a pipe character (|) but if your CSV file
          uses a different character to separate columns you can change it. If
          the columns are separated by tabs then enter \t into the 'Column
          separator' box. Lastly, there is a dropdown box titled 'Non-identifier
          field'. This just refers to the other column of data that you are
          trying to import into the database. Select the field you would like
          to import into and then click 'Select and import 2-column CSVs'.
