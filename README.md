# Bioimages Collection Manager

Bioimages Collection Manager was created to ease the process of adding images of living organisms and metadata about them to the [Bioimages website](http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu). The target user is the professional or serious amateur who is interested in contributing high quality images and accurate descriptive data of instances of biodiversity.

Cross-platform and open-source, the software was designed with minimal dependencies making it very simple to install as well as to extend and build it yourself if you wish.

No internet connection is required which makes it useful at remote sites, but web services such as reverse geocoding and updating the database to the latest published version of the Bioimages metadata are built into the software if you wish to use them.

Metadata collected follow biodiversity informatics best practices using terms from the Biodiversity Information Standards ([TDWG](http://www.tdwg.org/)), the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative ([DMCI](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/)), and the Darwin-SW Ontology ([DSW](https://github.com/darwin-sw/dsw)). Due to following these standards, the data users input into this software and submit are of great use to biodiversity researchers and the public. In addition to the Bioimages website data submitted are also sent to biodiversity aggregators such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility ([GBIF](http://www.gbif.org/)) and the Encyclopedia of Life ([EOL](http://eol.org/)).

If you would like to contribute images to the project, please contact [Steve Baskauf](mailto:steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu).
